# OOP Version of the Pizza POS System

This project contains the source code for the OOP version of the “Domain Modeling” lessons
in my book, [Learning Functional Programming in Scala](https://gumroad.com/l/lfpis).

There are two primary directories in this project:

- *v1_true_oop* contains the OOP code you’d write if you wanted to stick to the
  OOP model, and use private fields with getter and setter methods
- *v2_simple_oop* contains simpler versions of the OOP code that makes the
  class fields public

The *common* package contains the traits that are common to both of those
code versions, including the `Topping`, `CrustSize`, and `CrustType` traits.

This project isn’t intended to show a perfect OOP design; it’s just intended
to provide a quick OOP review and a means to show a contrast with FP
styles.
